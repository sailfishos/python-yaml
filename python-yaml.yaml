Description: |
    YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and
    interaction with scripting languages.  PyYAML is a YAML parser and
    emitter for Python.
    
    PyYAML features a complete YAML 1.1 parser, Unicode support, pickle
    support, capable extension API, and sensible error messages.  PyYAML
    supports standard YAML tags and provides Python-specific tags that allow
    to represent an arbitrary Python object.
    
    PyYAML is applicable for a broad range of tasks from complex
    configuration files to object serialization and persistance.
